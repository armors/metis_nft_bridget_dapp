      <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c3">Token Characteristics.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c8" style="padding-left: 0;margin-left: 36pt;"><span class="c4">The Metis Token is a transferable representation of attributed functions specified in the protocol/code of the Protocol, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token on the Protocol.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8" style="padding-left: 0;margin-left: 36pt;"><span class="c4">The Metis Token is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants on the Protocol in a decentralized manner. The goal of introducing the Metis Token is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the Protocol, and it is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public (or a section of the public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; nor is it designed or intended to be used by any person as payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not exclusively provided by the issuer. The Metis Token does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in any Metis Party or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will the Metis Token entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. The Metis Token may only be used on the Protocol, and ownership of Metis Token carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use Metis Token as a means to enable usage of and interaction within the Protocol.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8" style="padding-left: 0;margin-left: 36pt;"><span class="c4">The Metis Token also provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to contribute and maintain the ecosystem on the Protocol. The Metis Token is an integral and indispensable part of the Protocol, because without the Metis Token, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on the Protocol. Given that additional Metis Tokens will be awarded to users based only on its actual usage, activity and contribution on the Protocol, users of the Protocol and/or holders of Metis Token which did not actively participate will not receive any Metis Token incentives.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8" style="padding-left: 0;margin-left: 36pt;"><span class="c4">The Metis Tokens are designed to be used, and the project to develop the Protocol would fail if all Metis Token holders simply held onto their Metis Token and did nothing with it. In particular, it is highlighted that the Metis Token:</span>
    </p>
    <ol class="c0 lst-kix_list_2-3" start="5">
      <li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">does not have any tangible or physical manifestation, and does not have any intrinsic value (nor does any person make any representation or give any commitment as to its value);</span>

      <li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other digital asset) or any payment obligation by any Metis Party;</span>

      <li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to us or any of our affiliates, revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future dividends, revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property or licence rights), right to receive accounts, financial statements or other financial data, the right to requisition or participate in shareholder meetings, the right to nominate a director, or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the Protocol, us and/or our service providers;</span>
